# Java-Talk
Java Talk  In simple word it is just a quora for java developers having queries related to java only. The basic idea of the project is to provide a connectivity to the java learners with java experts or other java learners with help of which they can post and resolve their java related queries .The query which has been posted is public and anyone who is willing to resolve the query can post their answers.One query can have multiple answers by bdifferent or same user so that the most efficient answer can be selected .This web app also comes with the facility of testing the ones java skills by providing to them a online mcq test.Although the innitial phase of this project is logging in and if the user is new then he has to register himself.Also this project comes with the facility of session tracking due to which a user can not directly visit a user's home page which also provide a security to the user's account.The back end or server side code of this web app is entirely based on jsp with connectivity provided through jdbc and the database used is Mysql (iske alawa apache tomcat include karna ho to karliyo machine used or server used mein!!!!!).Apart from these the front end of the web app has been defined by the efficient use of html,css and javascript.[Use of all three languages chas been kept interconnected and well organised - ye line apne hisab se dekh le ].Along with the knowledge of all languages mentioned above the use of core java is also kept into the account as one part of the project i.e.,the online test is made entirely out of the core java knowledge and skills.
